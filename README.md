# Overview

This is a rather simple little app in terms of function, not so simple in terms of execution. 
It is an app that displays gifs of crabs dancing and plays music as well. 

The app consists of 4 screens: a home screen and 3 sub screens. To navigate the app,
the user simply presses a button to navigate to a sub screen and presses the return button
to return to home screen. Music begin playing and a gif will be displayed when the user
travels to each subscreen. 

My primary reason for making this app was I mostly just wanted to get some experience making an android app using the kotlin language.

# Development Environment

For this app, I utilized android studio and developed in kotlin and xml.

I used several kotlin libraries for this project:
- Media player
- Glide
- ImageView

# Future Work
As far as future improvements go, I mostly want to work on improving the layout and design of the screens.
* Item 1: improve design of app
* Item 2: add app thumbnail
* Item 3: improve button layout
